## Installation Steps

To set up Token Kit for your project, follow these steps:

1. Install shadcn/ui
2. Install RainbowKit

### 1. Install shadcn/ui

First, follow the installation guide for shadcn/ui. This will set up the base components and styling for your project.

[shadcn/ui Installation Guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)

Choose the framework you're using (e.g., Next.js, Vite, Remix, etc.) and follow the instructions provided.

### 2. Install RainbowKit

After setting up shadcn/ui, install RainbowKit and its peer dependencies. This will add the necessary Web3 functionality to your project.

Follow the official RainbowKit installation guide:

[RainbowKit Installation Guide](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation)

This will guide you through installing RainbowKit along with its required dependencies (wagmi, viem, and react-query).

## Next Steps

After completing these installation steps, you'll have a project set up with both shadcn/ui components and Web3 functionality from RainbowKit and its associated libraries.

You can now start building your Web3 app using Token Kit components, which combine the styling of shadcn/ui with the blockchain interaction capabilities of RainbowKit.

For more information on using specific Token Kit components, check out our [Components](/docs/components) section.
