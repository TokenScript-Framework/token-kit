description: This is the lambda function that generates the Farcaster Frame for the token.
component: false

## Overview

The `lambdas/farcaster/` is an AWS Lambda@Edge function designed to dynamically generate Farcaster Frame for tokens. It will generate the required `<head>` for the Farcaster Frame and merge it with the original `<body>` from S3. You can share your link to Wrapcast or other social media platforms which support Farcaster Frame.

## Build

To set up the lambda function, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

1. Package the lambda function:

   ```bash
   pnpm package
   ```

This process will generate a `token-kit-farcaster-lambda.zip` file that can be uploaded to AWS Lambda.

## Deploy

To deploy the lambda function, follow these steps:

1. Create a new AWS Lambda function in **_us-east-1_** using the `token-kit-farcaster-lambda.zip` file generated in the previous step.
2. Set the property permissions to AWS Lambda Basic Execution Role (with S3 access).
3. Publish to your CloudFront **_Origin request_** function associations.

## How it works

```txt
Request  ---->  [CloudFront] [Lambda@Edge] <--- S3 (original html <body>)
Response <----                         ^----- farcaster frame service API (html <head>)
```

The Lambda@Edge function will merge the original html `<body>` from S3 with the html `<head>` from the farcaster frame service API response.

Since Lambda@Edge cannot get the response from the origin (See: [Work with requests and responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-generating-http-responses.html)), so we read the original html from S3 and replace the `<head>` with the `<head>` from the farcaster frame service API response.

We expect you use S3 + CloudFront to serve your static files with SPA. If your static files structure is different, you may need to modify the code.

And we expect the URL parameters are:

- `chainId` (number): the chainId of the network, like 1, 137, and so on
- `contract` (string): the contract address of the token (0x....)
- `tokenId` (number): the tokenId of the token

Full request URL example: `https://example.com/?chainId=1&contract=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890&tokenId=1`
